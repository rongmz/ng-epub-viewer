# Ng Epub Viewer

## A viewer for epub files for Angular 6+.


While there are plenty of epub viewers out there on github and npm, I couldn't find any suitable library with user friendly epub viewer in js and with Angular 6+.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
